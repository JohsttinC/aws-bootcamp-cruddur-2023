## Homework Challenges

### Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, IAM role

I added a MFA to my root account and created an IAM account also with MFA, activated access to Billing from IAM user, created a new IAM role and assigned Billing access through policy, now I can use my IAM account to almost any task and the root account will not be used unless is required for some specific task.

### Research the technical and service limits of specific services and how they could impact the technical path for technical flexibility.

AWS has quotas and service limits, the service limits is a protection to unexpected excessive provisioning with this AWS protect to increase your bill from malicious actions or mistakes in deployment, this would be a problem if you reach the service limit and you still need more Compute Resource but you can just open a ticket requesting a service limit increase, You can monitor your quotas in the Service Quotas Dashboard
